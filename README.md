It's primal data is based on the [StarlingDB](https://starlingdb.org) project. Due to the instability of the website and the the lack of any continuation of the project its data was used as a base for this project.

We thank Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin for his work and dedication to the project and hope he may forever rest in peace.
